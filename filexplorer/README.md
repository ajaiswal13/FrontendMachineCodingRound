# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Step by step execution

1. Fetch the data in App component
2. Pass it down to the Folder component as props
3. Create the parent div containing root folder and also the child div containing nested folders
4. Add showing and hiding functionality of nested folders on click of parent div using state
5. Add conditional rendering for displaying either folder or file
   (Refer to my implementation as video's implementation is a bit confusing in terms of HTML and css)
6. Call the folder component recursively
7. Add (Folder+ or File+)two buttons infront of the folder
8. Add state variables to create a file or folder
9. Update state variable with the value of file or folder on click of button respective to file
   or folder.
10. Stop progation on the (Folder+ or File+)button click as earlier it was opening the nested folders on button click
11. Add focus to the input boxes and add blur effect to close the div
    containing input box once user clicks outside.
12. Update the state variable to state visibility as false on the blur effect.
13. Expand the folder on (Folder+ or File+)button click
14. Check how to use onKeyDown(Very imp). We don't have to pass arrow function in this.Just call the method directly.

NOTE : Same logic can be used for 'comment section' structure like of reddit, youtube
